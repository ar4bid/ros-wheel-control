# ROS Wheel Control

ROS Wheel Control was written by Alex White.

This ROS package was written in 2018-2019 for use on the Queen's Space Engineering Team's (QSET) mobile robotic platform. This package was originally hosted on QSET's gitlab and has been copied to my personal repo as an exemplar of code I have written. Nearly all code in this repo was written by myself.
